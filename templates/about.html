                                This website visually pairs gun crimes in Chicago from 2011-2016 with Census tracts in the city and corresponding data from the American Community Surveys for 2011 and 2016.

                                Census data comes from the 2011 and 2016 American Community Survey conducted by the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/">U.S. Census Bureau</a>. Gun crime data comes from <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Gun-Crimes/ta3m-92yk/data">gun crimes database</a> from the Chicago Data Portal. I filtered this database to receive only gun crimes that were defined as either a "battery" or "assault" for the years 2011-2016, to correspond with the Census data. The interactive map was built with <a href="https://carto.com">Carto</a>.

                               One limitation of this app includes the accuracy of gun crime locations. Because the Chicago Police Department publishes location data for the block but not the specific address, exact locations of gun crimes cannot be completely determined. As well, there are many factors that impact gentrification in a neighborhood, from income levels to educational achievement. While Census data for several variables are provided in tables, I use median home values as the proxy for gentrified areas in the city of Chicago. This is based on a <a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-trends/2013-economic-trends/et-20131106-gentrification-and-financial-health.aspx">study on gentrification</a> by Daniel Hartley of the Cleveland Federal Reserve. In his study, he used median home values as the main measure of gentrification because "Housing prices are a good measure of gentrification since they provide a summary of the various amenities in the neighborhood. Changes in neighborhood amenities such as increases in school quality or decreases in crime should be reflected in changes in neighborhood home prices."
