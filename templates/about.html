                                This website visually pairs gun crimes in Chicago from 2011-2016 with Census tracts in the city and corresponding data from the American Community Surveys for 2011 and 2016.

                                There are many factors that impact gentrification in a neighborhood, from income levels to educational achievement. While Census data for several variables are provided in tables, I use median home values as the proxy for gentrified areas in the city of Chicago. This is based on a <a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-trends/2013-economic-trends/et-20131106-gentrification-and-financial-health.aspx">study on gentrification</a> by Daniel Hartley of the Cleveland Federal Reserve. In his study, he used median home values as the main measure of gentrification because "Housing prices are a good measure of gentrification since they provide a summary of the various amenities in the neighborhood. Changes in neighborhood amenities such as increases in school quality or decreases in crime should be reflected in changes in neighborhood home prices."
