<h1>Education: Gateway to the Best?</h1>
<p>(working title)</p>

<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
<p>The link between education and proclivity to commit crimes has been well-established by researchers and sociologists. Many in law enforcement, government and social groups point to the importance of schooling as a factor in reducing crime.</p>

<p>What about in St. Louis, Missouri, often ranked as one of the most crime-ridden cities in the United States? My app will pair Attendance Rates for St. Louis City schools against crime data published by the St. Louis Police Department to navigate this link between crime and education.</p>

<h2>Inspirations and prior work </h2>
<a href="https://graphics.stltoday.com/apps/crime/index.html">St. Louis Crime Tracker</a>
<p>This web app shows year-over-year change for crime incidents in the city of St. Louis, organized by neighborhood. The app allows the user to choose to view crimes by type (violent or property) and choose year-over-year change or per-capita incidents. It is fairly straightforward and provides a sense of which neighborhoods experience the most crime and which have the highest changes.</p>

<a href="http://hechingerreport.org/the-gradation-rates-from-every-school-district-in-one-map/">Graduation Rates from Every School District in One Map</a>
<p>This map of the United States shows the graduation rates for each public school district in the country. What is interesting is that these rates vary greatly even within the same state. I like the simplicity in that you can visually judge which areas have the lowest and which have the hihghest without having to absorb much data.</p>

<a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/data/ct-shooting-victims-map-charts-htmlstory.html">Chicago Tribune's Shooting Victims Map</a>
<p>Chicago, notorious for its gun violence, provides robust crime data that reimagines the way we can perceive the city. One visualization that I like on this page, which provides several charts and tables with shooting data, is the heatmap of where shootings occur. I think that being able to see the high-crime areas provides a good understanding of the prevalence of violence in certain neighborhoods. </p>
