<h1>Education: Gateway to the Best?</h1>
<p>(working title)</p>

<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
<p>The link between education and proclivity to commit crimes has been well-established by researchers and sociologists. Many in law enforcement, government and social groups point to the importance of schooling as a factor in reducing crime.</p>

<p>What about in St. Louis, Missouri, often ranked as one of the most crime-ridden cities in the United States? My app will pair attendance rates for St. Louis City schools against crime data published by the St. Louis Police Department to navigate this link between crime and education.</p>

<h2>Inspirations and prior work </h2>
<a href="https://graphics.stltoday.com/apps/crime/index.html">St. Louis Crime Tracker</a> 
<p>This web app shows year-over-year change for crime incidents in the city of St. Louis, organized by neighborhood. The app allows the user to choose to view crimes by type (violent or property) and choose year-over-year change or per-capita incidents. It is fairly straightforward and provides a sense of which neighborhoods experience the most crime and which have the highest changes.</p>

<a href="http://hechingerreport.org/the-gradation-rates-from-every-school-district-in-one-map/">Graduation Rates from Every School District in One Map</a> 
<p>This map of the United States shows the graduation rates for each public school district in the country. What is interesting is that these rates vary greatly even within the same state. I like the simplicity in that you can visually judge which areas have the lowest and which have the highest without having to interpret much data.</p>

<a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/data/ct-shooting-victims-map-charts-htmlstory.html">Chicago Tribune's Shooting Victims Map</a> 
<p>Chicago, notorious for its gun violence, provides robust crime data that reimagines the way we can perceive the city. One visualization that I like on this page, which provides several charts and tables with shooting data, is the heatmap of where shootings occur. I think that being able to see the map provides a good understanding of the prevalence of violence in certain neighborhoods. </p>

<ul>The main thing that will differentiate my app from the others is that none of these pair attendance rates with crime incidents. Each app focuses on one metric: shooting/crime incidents or district graduation rates. Mine will attempt to pair the two in order to provide more context.</ul>
<ul>While I appreciate STLTODAY's graphic on year-over-year change, I wish it provided a tooltip that gave more information about that neighborhood: population and median income, to start. My app would provide the following data points: attendance rates, number of crime incidents, population and median income. I think even knowing this simple information could give more insight into differences between neighborhoods.</ul>
<ul>Whereas the Chicago Tribune provides several data charts to display their information, I think it is easy to get lost on that page because of the sheer amount of information they provide. I would like to make my app more streamlined, in that it consists mainly of a map and tooltips, along with a written section under the map for explanation.</ul>
<ul>Finally, I want to take advantage of the up-to-date data available for both attendance rates and crime incidents. The Missouri Department of Education and St. Louis Police Department regularly publish data that are readily available. To my knowledge, a web-app based on these data does not exist currently.</ul>

<h2>Articles</h2>
<a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-02-19/news/ct-met-prison-truancy-20130219_1_much-school-public-schools-grades">Court files show link between school truancy and crime</a> <p>This story highlights prison data that links school absence in early childhood with higher rates of incarceration. According to the article, absenteeism is a growing problem in Chicago public schools, which may have a relationship with the city's high violent crime rate. Anecdotally, many prisoners attribute lack of education and schooling with their behaviors that landed them in prison.</p>

<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/stories-42254527">School attendance and absence: the facts </a> <p>This article, while based in the U.K., looks at the reasons that students miss school, ranging from sickness to depression to boredom. It also compares the levels of absenteeism with income, crime and health levels, and found the link between truancy and other factors not as strong as previously considered.</p>

<a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/not-in-class-chronic-absenteeism-a-problem-throughout-region-s/article_7d8e0e34-4394-5ea8-9561-33299db1fe07.html">Not in class: Chronic absenteeism a problem throughout region's schools </a> <p>Data from St. Louis Public Schools show that more than one in ten students missed school so frequently that they are considered academically at-risk. Interestingly, the problem affects struggling schools as well as wealthy districts. The article highlights that by high school, chronic absenteeism can lead to higher chances of living in poverty and being involved with the criminal justice system.</p>
